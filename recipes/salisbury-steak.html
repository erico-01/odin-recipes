    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Salisbury steak is a variation of the Hamburg steak, which is an ancestor of the hamburger. 
        Salisbury steaks are usually made from a blend of ground beef and other ingredients, then topped with a thick brown gravy. 
        The dish is named after James H. Salisbury, a doctor who promoted a meat-centered diet.
